This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

For this application I use material UI, you can find documentation [here](https://material-ui-next.com/).
For createing markup I use BEM methotology and SASS for creating styles. For state management redux. I do not use any middlewares like thunk or saga here because there is no asynchronous operations.
