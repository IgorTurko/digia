This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

For this application I use material UI. Documentation for this you can find [here](https://material-ui-next.com/).
I use SASS for creating styles component and redux for state management. There is no any middleware like thunk or saga because there is no asynchronous operations.
